# LibLab - V1.0
### by Tibor √Åser Veres (@RPBCACUEAIIBH)

- Multi platform library development template, that allows the user to test the same C++ library on multople diferent microcontrollers and PC. (eg. I'm trying to make HexaLib v2.0 usable on AVR, RP2040, ESP8266, as well as AMD64, and maybe even STM32 even though some features may be specific to a certain platform.)
