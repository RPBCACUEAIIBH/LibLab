# LibLab - V1.0
### by Tibor √Åser Veres (@RPBCACUEAIIBH)

- Multi platform library development template, that allows the user to test the same C++ library on multople diferent microcontrollers and PC. (eg. I'm trying to make HexaLib v2.0 usable on AVR, RP2040, ESP8266, as well as AMD64, and maybe even STM32 even though some features may be specific to a certain platform.)


## How to use
- Clone it to your arduino project folder.
- Open in Arduino ide. (v2.X.X recommended since that makes switching between multiple connected platforms easy.)
- Click upload to test on selected device. (Currently works on AVR, ESP8266, RP2040 and PC, but adding other architectures is relatively easy.)
- You can also compile Source/Main.cpp on PC. (On Ubuntu you can just run Build.sh for that. On Windows / Mac you may have to set up make or something similar.)
